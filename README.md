# week-6-weather-app-Graham

## User Story
As a traveler
I want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
So that I can plan a trip accordingly

## Acceptance Criteria

Given a weather dashboard with form inputs
When I search for a city
Then I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
When I view current weather conditions for that city
Then I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
When I view future weather conditions for that city
Then I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
When I click on a city in the search history
Then I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
